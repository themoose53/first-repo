#Field Trip!

Hey guys! This week I took a visit to [Drifty][http://drifty.com/], a tech company that created Ionic, a software developer kit for mobile apps with web applications. Their office had a pretty cool and relaxing feeling as they showed us Ionic and Firebase, a realtime database which provides an API for developers and clients.
