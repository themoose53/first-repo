#Hello again!

This week I've learned about JavaScript!

It turns out JavaScript isn't related to Java, but I learned about expressions, statements, operators, values, strings, booleans, variables, and special numbers.

##Expressions

code that produces a value is an expression. An example of this is:
`22`

##Statements

A statement can be one or more expressions. An expression is also a statement.

##Operators

There are different kinds of operators. There are logical operators, binary operators, and unary operators. Logical operators are the "and" "or", and "not" operators. These can be used for booleans.

The "and" operator is written as `&&`. Its result is true only if both values given to it are true. Example:
`console.log (true && false)`
This will return as false.

The "or" operator is written as `||`. Its result is true if at least one of its values given to it are true. Example:
`console.log(false || true)`
This will return as true.

The "not" operator is written as `!`. This operator returns the opposite of the value given to it. This operator can be used in conjuction with comparison operators (<, >, =, ) Example:
`!false`
This will return as true.
