#Hello reader

Welcome to my blog! 
In this blog I'll review what I have learned about programming.

Recently I've learned about how to use the command line. 

The 'pwd' command stands for 'print working directory'. This command will print the current directory you're in on the command window.

The 'hostname' command prints out the computer's network name.

The 'mkdir' command is short for 'make directory'. This command creates a new directory. An argument is added which will be the name of the new directory.

The 'cd' command stands for 'change directory'. This command will change what directory you want to go into. An argument is added which will be the name of the directory you want to go into.

The 'ls' command is short for 'list'. This command lists all of the files and folders in the current directory. The '-a' option can be added to show hidden files as well.

Well that's all for now. These are only a handful of commands. There are many more commands out there.
