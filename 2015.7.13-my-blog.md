#Hey all,

I've just been at Madison + UX. It's a great conference for people who are interested in user design to meet and talk about it. There were a lot of speakers who talked about a whole range of things. There were also booths for companies that you could visit to learn more information about. You also can't forget about all of the swags!

Madison + UX lasts for two days, each having an after-party. This was my first, and last time I'll be at Madison + UX as it won't be hosted at all anymore. That's unfortunate as I really enjoyed it and I hope something similar pops up.
