# Pay attention to detail!

Here's a reminder to pay attention to detail while coding. I ran into a problem while coding and it took me hours to figure out that the problem was that I forgot to insert a comma. Don't let this mistake happen to you! Re-read your work slowly and carefully. Sometimes your problem is actually way simpler than you thought.
